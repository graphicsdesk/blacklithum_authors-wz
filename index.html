            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ten years ago, Columbia added its first text by a Black author to the Literature Humanities curriculum: “Song of Solomon” by Toni Morrison.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The curriculum has undergone multiple revisions, most notably between 2019 and 2021, when the Committee on the Core added four texts by Black authors to the syllabus. Since then, the committee has cut several texts, leaving Morrison and Claudia Rankine, SoA ’93, as the only Black authors on the syllabus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Founded in 1937, Lit Hum is intended to encourage students to read “with and against the grain of canon and tradition,” according to the course’s website. The class teaches texts by Homer, Virgil, Plato, and many other works considered canonical texts in the Western tradition.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In 1985, two years after Columbia began admitting female students, the University added Jane Austen to the curriculum, making her the first woman on the syllabus. In 2015, Morrison became the first living and first Black author to be added to the curriculum.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Masterpieces of Western Literature and Philosophy, the formal name of the course, is a required first-year seminar for all students in Columbia College. Beginning in fall 2025, this name will be dropped and the course will officially be known as Literature Humanities—the name students and faculty have called the course for years.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The texts written by Black authors currently on the Lit Hum syllabus are “Song of Solomon”<i> </i>by Morrison and “Citizen: An American Lyric” by Rankine, which the committee added in 2021. “Notebook of a Return to the Native Land” by Aimé Césaire, “The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas” by Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, and “Father Comes Home from the Wars” by Suzan-Lori Parks were all added and removed from the syllabus between 2019 and 2024.

  “Father Comes Home from the Wars” was first added to the Core in fall 2019 as an <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/09/04/annually-rotating-student-faculty-chosen-text-to-be-added-to-lit-hum-syllabus/">annually rotating contemporary text</a>. However, this “Contemporary Core” rotating slot was discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic because the committee “didn’t have the capacity to keep changing what was in that slot,” according to Joseph Howley, associate professor of classics and the Paule Brooke program chair of Literature Humanities.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Literature Humanities instructors taught “Father Comes Home from the Wars” in fall 2020, and the committee formally codified the text in the syllabus review in 2021, replacing “The Clouds” by Aristophanes.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Howley said the cuts were a result of too many texts being added in 2021. That year, the committee added four books and removed 13—three by Black authors, and the remainder by non-Black authors—bringing the total on the syllabus to 33 books. The Lit Hum reading list in 2020 was composed of 24 texts. In 2021, the number increased to 33.

  <b>The Committee on the Core</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Howley said the committee cut Black authors from the curriculum because they were among the most recent additions to the curriculum.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “That is one of the things I’ve come to understand as the essential question of whoever sits in my chair, not just the intellectual, pedagogical, or political questions of what should we read, but the very practical question of what can we all read together in 14 weeks in the most productive way?” Howley said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The decision to cut texts from the curriculum comes from a Core review process which occurs every three years. The committee is made up of Lit Hum instructors who have taught the course within the last five years and are still affiliated with the University. Committee members range from tenured professors to advanced graduate students.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Those folks, the postdocs and the grad students, aren’t going to stick around long enough to be eligible for multiple rounds of these votes,” Howley said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The process—which involves a survey, town hall meetings, a feedback session, and a final vote to pass the syllabus—is influenced by a “substantial” voting constituency composed of tenure-track faculty, according to Larry Jackson, associate dean for academic affairs and director of the Center for the Core Curriculum at Columbia College. Over 100 instructors are eligible to vote on the syllabus, which Jackson said passes with 75 to 90 percent in favor.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Jackson and Howley said that the addition of Black authors to the curriculum in 2021 did not happen solely because those texts were “timely,” referring to the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that the urgency of that moment and the issues that were being discussed in that moment accelerated changes that were already underway, that we were already trying to make happen,” Jackson told Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Jackson said that because the process of revising the Core is a “collective project” involving many people, it is difficult to make rapid changes.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “That is never going to move at the speed of an online post or the speed of a CNN breaking news update,” Jackson said. “We’re always going to be a little behind the world because we’re trying to achieve some perspective on the world and be able to analyze it and be able to understand it.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hannah Carter, CC ’26, a former Lit Hum student, described the addition of texts by Black authors to the Lit Hum syllabus in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement as a “move to placate Black students.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “To have Black students on campus and sort of give us a bone for three years and then snatch it back as soon as people aren’t necessarily as focused on racial justice is very upsetting,” Carter said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Carter said she feels these cuts are related to the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It reminds me of a lot of the DEI rollbacks that we’re seeing around the country right now, as President Trump is gearing up to remove any sign of citizens of color being productive members of our society,” Carter said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Brendan Sarpong, CC ’26, CEO of the Columbia Black Pre-Professional Society, said that he felt the changes in the syllabus were an attempt from the University to prioritize optics.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Instead of maybe considering what these communities that they’re trying to service, these communities that they’re trying to help, would actually want, there’s this kind of impulse to just do what they think will make them look best optically,” he said. “I don’t think that’s best for improving anyone’s material conditions.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Sarpong said he does not fully understand the committee’s process, but he still felt change to the review procedures was necessary.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It would benefit them to reconsider their approach, be more deliberate, be more critical of their methodology,” he said. “Don’t get scared.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Howley said he empathizes with the perspective of students who are frustrated with the additions and removals from the syllabus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think I would really understand that some of this really jumps out,” he said. “It pops out and seems conspicuous that there are these non-white voices or otherwise voices that seem to come from historically marginalized or minoritized communities or backgrounds that have sort of been added and then cut again.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A Columbia College spokesperson declined to comment beyond the comments made by Jackson and Howley.

  <b>‘Instructor’s choice’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature and Lit Hum instructor, who has been at Columbia for nearly four decades, said he has witnessed change in the curriculum during his time.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It has evolved, but it has evolved not just because a group committee sat and thought, ‘Oh, we were going to include African Americans,’” Dabashi said. “The Core is a very organic phenomenon. It’s not solid. It’s not carbon.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Though several Lit Hum instructors agree with the cuts, Howley referenced debates around the removal of some of the books: “Father Comes Home from the Wars” by Parks was one of them.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Parks was one of these ones where the ‘yes’ votes, as it were, were very enthusiastic, but they were not a preponderance of the instructors,” he said. “So instructors were flagging for us that they were really struggling with it.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Instructors cited the difficulty of suddenly switching from ancient to contemporary texts, preserving the chronological order of the texts, and its lack of connection to the other texts on the syllabus as concerns, Howley said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Sarpong said that while he enjoyed texts by Black authors like “Father Comes Home from the Wars,” he did not feel that they were chosen with “the care and more deliberate picking that it needed” and felt that the texts were “shoehorned.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  To address differing preferences between professors, Howley pointed to “instructor’s choice”—a policy under which an instructor can choose to teach a certain book each semester, even if it is cut from the course-wide syllabus.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Tamara Hache, a teaching fellow and Core instructor, is among many Lit Hum instructors who chose to continue teaching “Father Comes Home from the Wars” as her instructor’s choice text in the fall.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I definitely think that because it is a contemporary piece and it also engages with ‘The Odyssey’ and other sort of ancient textual forms that we had been looking at, it’s sort of great,” Hache said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Father Comes Home from the Wars” is a loose retelling of Homer’s “The Odyssey”—one of the first texts taught in Lit Hum. The text follows the journey of an enslaved person who chooses to fight for the Confederacy with his enslaver upon being promised freedom in return. “Song of Solomon” is also a loose retelling of “The Odyssey,” following the protagonist Milkman as he journeys to the American South. The novel also makes reference to Song of Songs, a biblical text that was previously taught in Lit Hum.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hache chose to keep Shakespeare’s “Othello” on her spring semester syllabus, though the committee had replaced it with Shakespeare’s “King Lear.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The committee included “Othello” in the syllabus to coincide with the semester-long “Such Sweet Thunder” celebration at Columbia, which recognized the contributions of Duke Ellington and Shakespeare. Hache described how Othello, who is identified in the play as a Black man, allows for critical engagement with racial narratives.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I feel like Othello works way better, because, again, it can bring up issues of race that we have been discussing,” Hache said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>‘Not in what we teach but how we teach it’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Howley said that the “preferred remedy” to the “history of exclusion that parts of the reading list have been entangled with” is “not in what we teach but how we teach it,” explaining how texts can be approached in different ways.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There are ways of teaching Homer that lean further towards or further away the histories of classicism and racism and exclusion that a Homer-centered canon has traditionally been associated with,” Howley said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Current training for Lit Hum instructors includes a weekly lecture delivered by an expert on the next book to be read, according to Howley.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “For example, Emily Wilson’s translation of ‘The Odyssey’ has been in a lot of discussion in the field of classical scholarship, about how we translate terms around race and identity out of the Homeric Greek,” he said. “I’ve made sure to bring expert lecturers who can talk about that with us.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Carter emphasized the importance of a different kind of training, focused specifically on training instructors in facilitating “tough conversations.” Carter said she was “fortunate” to have a professor that did this, but many of her friends did not share a similar experience.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “When you have a bunch of fresh-faced 18-year-olds that are still adjusting to everything that goes around here, you do rely on your professor to guide you,” she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  She said that if the instructor fails in this capacity, Black students are placed in a difficult position.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Black students should not be carrying the burden of leading that uncomfortable discussion in class every time the N-word is mentioned or the book is about slavery,” Carter said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The committee has also made changes to the chronology of the texts.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For the first time, in fall 2024,“The Iliad” was not the first assigned reading of the fall semester. Students instead began with “Gilgamesh” and other texts that highlight a wider range of literary influences. Hache said these changes are “great.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We still have all our energy in our first couple of weeks. All of our attention can be devoted to that,” Hache said. “It’s also potentially a decolonial choice to be like, ‘Okay, we are destabilizing the chronology that guides literary studies in this academic context.’”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Rankine’s “Citizen” was also moved to the start of the spring semester. Howley said this placement was a result of many instructors independently choosing to teach the text at the beginning of the semester, when it was officially placed at the very end.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It shocks and interrogates the whole system, because the proverbial cliché about the Core is that it is by dead white men,” Dabashi said. “Claudia Rankine is alive, not dead, is not white, but Black, and is a woman, not a man.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hache said that the inclusion of texts from a diverse range of perspectives led to engaging discourse and heightened interest in the classroom.
</p>
